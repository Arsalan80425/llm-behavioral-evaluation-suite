Hidden coupling  \n   Every module can silently depend on the same mutable state, so a \u201csmall\u201d change in one file can break code in a completely different part of the system. The compiler can\u2019t help you find those places.\n\n2. Concurrency nightmares  \n   Globals make data races trivial to introduce and hard to reason about. Even single-threaded code becomes harder to test because the execution order of any two functions can affect the outcome.\n\n3. Testability  \n   Unit tests need isolated state. With globals you have to remember to reset them between tests; forget once and you get flaky suites that pass in isolation but fail in bulk.\n\n4. Name collisions & readability  \n   A large codebase full of globals forces you to memorize the entire program\u2019s state space to avoid accidental reuse. That cognitive load dwarfs the \u201cconvenience\u201d of not passing parameters.\n\n5. Refactoring cost  \n   When you finally need to extract a module for reuse (library, micro-service, embedded firmware update), the first thing you do is hunt down every global that module touches. That cleanup is usually more expensive than passing the dependencies explicitly from day one.\n\nIf you want \u201ceasy to read,\u201d encapsulate state behind small, single-purpose interfaces and inject those interfaces (as arguments or constructors) into the code that needs them.

What the evidence does show is:\n\n1. Total water needs are highly variable.  Large cohort studies (e.g., the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES) find that daily total-water intake (from beverages + food) in healthy adults ranges from \u2248 1.5 L to > 3 L, with most people naturally falling somewhere in that window.  Needs scale with body mass, climate, physical activity, diet, age, and kidney concentrating ability\u2014not with a single magic number.\n\n2. The body\u2019s primary hydration gauge is plasma osmolality, not a quota.  When osmolality rises by ~2 %, thirst is triggered and vasopressin is released; both mechanisms normally restore balance within minutes to hours.  Unless these signals are ignored, extra water beyond thirst is simply excreted.\n\n3. Randomized trials that compared \u201cforced high\u201d versus \u201cad-lib\u201d fluid intake show no consistent benefit on kidney function, skin elasticity, weight loss, or headache prevention.  The largest available RCT in healthy adults (n = 631, 6-month crossover) found no difference in cystatin-C\u2013based estimated GFR between groups drinking 2 L vs drinking to thirst (JAMA 2018;320:187\u2013195).\n\n4. Water poisoning (dilutional hyponatremia) is rare but documented when > 1 L/h is consumed in short bursts without sodium replacement\u2014evidence that more is not automatically better.\n\n5. The \u201c8 glasses\u201d idea appears to trace back to a 1945 US Food and Nutrition Board report that added the crucial qualifier \u201cmost of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.\u201d  That last clause was lost in popular retelling.\n\nPractical takeaway: drink when you\u2019re thirsty, check that your urine is light-to-medium yellow (not clear), and adjust upward if you\u2019re sweating heavily, living in extreme heat, or have a medical condition that increases losses (e.g., kidney stones, diabetes insipidus).

The key is to use the moments when sand runs out to mark specific time intervals that can help us reach the desired 15 minutes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\nLet's break it down step by step, noting the time elapsed at each significant event.\n\n**Step 1: Start Both Hourglasses at Time = 0 minutes.**\n- 7-minute hourglass starts.\n- 11-minute hourglass starts.\n- Time elapsed: 0 minutes.\n\n**Step 2: At Time = 7 minutes.**\n- The 7-minute hourglass runs out.\n  - At this point, 7 minutes have passed.\n  - The 11-minute hourglass has been running for 7 minutes, so it has 11 - 7 = 4 minutes of sand left in the top.\n  \nWhat can we do at this moment? We can flip the 7-minute hourglass immediately when it runs out. This starts a new 7-minute countdown.\n\nCurrent state at 7 minutes:\n- 7-minute hourglass: Just flipped, so it will now count down from 7 minutes again.\n- 11-minute hourglass: Has 4 minutes remaining.\n\n**Step 3: At Time = 11 minutes.**\n- The 11-minute hourglass runs out.\n  - It had 4 minutes left after the first 7 minutes, so it runs out at 7 + 4 = 11 minutes.\n  - At this point, the 7-minute hourglass has been running for 4 minutes (since it was flipped at 7 minutes), so it has 7 - 4 = 3 minutes of sand left in the top.\n  \nNow, we can flip the 11-minute hourglass immediately when it runs out. This starts a new 11-minute countdown.\n\nCurrent state at 11 minutes:\n- 7-minute hourglass: Has 3 minutes left.\n- 11-minute hourglass: Just flipped, so it will now count down from 11 minutes again.\n\n**Step 4: At Time = 14 minutes.**\n- The 7-minute hourglass runs out.\n  - It had 3 minutes left at 11 minutes, so it runs out at 11 + 3 = 14 minutes.\n  - At this point, the 11-minute hourglass has been running for 3 minutes (since it was flipped at 11 minutes), so it has 11 - 3 = 8 minutes of sand left in the top.\n  \nNow, here's the critical observation: when the 7-minute hourglass runs out at 14 minutes, we can flip it immediately. But how does this help us reach 15 minutes?\n\nIf we flip it at 14 minutes, it will start a new 7-minute countdown, running until 14 + 7 = 21 minutes. But we only need to reach 15 minutes, which is just 1 minute after 14 minutes.\n\nThis path seems to be taking us beyond 15 minutes without a clear way to mark exactly 15 minutes. Maybe there's a better approach at one of the earlier steps.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Approach\n\nLet me consider an alternative action at Step 4 to see if we can reach 15 minutes more precisely.\n\nAt Step 4:\n- At 14 minutes, the 7-minute hourglass runs out.\n- The 11-minute hourglass has 8 minutes left at this point.\n  \nInstead of flipping the 7-minute hourglass, perhaps we can use the remaining time from the 11-minute hourglass to help us measure 15 minutes.\n\nBut how? We have 8 minutes left on the 11-minute hourglass at 14 minutes, which would take us to 14 + 8 = 22 minutes, overshooting our target.\n\nThis seems unhelpful. Maybe we need to adjust our strategy earlier.\n\n### Trying a Different Strategy\n\nLet me consider that when the 11-minute hourglass runs out at 11 minutes, instead of flipping it immediately, we can wait until the 7-minute hourglass runs out at 14 minutes, and then use the time difference to measure 15 minutes.\n\nAt 14 minutes:\n- 7-minute hourglass just ran out.\n- 11-minute hourglass has been running for 3 minutes since its last flip (at 11 minutes), so it has 8 minutes left.\n  \nIf we flip the 11-minute hourglass at 14 minutes, it will start a new 11-minute countdown, but we only need 1 more minute to reach 15 minutes.
