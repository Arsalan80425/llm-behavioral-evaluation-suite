However, this recommendation was not specifically for drinking water, but rather for total water intake from all sources, including water from foods.\n\nIn reality, the amount of water an individual needs depends on several factors, such as age, sex, weight, activity level, and climate. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has established the following daily water intake recommendations:\n\n- For adult men: 3.7 liters (about 125 ounces)\n- For adult women: 2.7 liters (about 91 ounces)\n- For pregnant women: 3 liters (about 101 ounces)\n- For breastfeeding women: 3.8 liters (about 128 ounces)\n\nIt's worth noting that these recommendations are for total water intake, not just drinking water. A significant portion of our daily water intake comes from other sources, such as:\n\n- Foods, like fruits, vegetables, and broth-based soups\n- Beverages, like milk, juice, and tea\n- Metabolic water production, where the body generates water as a byproduct of cellular metabolism\n\nAdditionally, the body has a complex system for regulating water balance, including the kidneys, which produce urine to excrete excess water. In most cases, the body can maintain proper hydration levels without needing to drink a specific amount of water each day.\n\nIn summary, while staying hydrated is essential for health, the idea that drinking 8 glasses of water a day is a well-established fact is a myth with no scientific basis.", "error": false, "duration_ms": 641.102, "timestamp": "2026-01-31T17:38:16.609353", "rule_based_scores": {}, "rule_pass_rate": null, "judge_score": 5, "judge_reasoning": "The response clearly and thoroughly debunks the myth of drinking 8 glasses of water a day, providing accurate scientific information and context to support its claim.", "judge_passes": true, "overall_pass": true, "human_score": 5, "human_passes": true, "human_notes": "Confirmed judge score 5/5", "human_reviewed": true}
